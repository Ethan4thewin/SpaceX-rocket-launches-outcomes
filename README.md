# SpaceX-rocket-launches-outcomes

This is a capstone project for IBM Applied Data Science Capstone course. The Falcon 9 first stage landing will be predicted, successfully or not. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if the first stage's landing outcomes can be determined, we can determine the cost of a launch.
